        <h2>Coding Experience</h2>
        <p>Currently, this site is my only fully-functional complete site, but I have more in the works. As soon as they're ready, they'll be added here.</p>
        <p>Here's a link to my <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/bradleyniedt">Treehouse account</a>. You can check out all of the badges I've earned by completeing classes.</p>
        <p>My journey to becoming a developer began a long time ago in 6th grade. We had a computer class where we played games and learded typing, but we also had the opportunity to play with HTML. Fast forward a decade and some change, where I found myself feeling unfufilled. I'd spend hours on the internet after coming home from work, wasting time until I would go to bed and start it all over again. I wasnt feeling like my creativity was being put to use, so I found a few links to some free online classes to re-learn some HTML and try out some CSS. After the first couple of classes, I was hooked. From then on, it has been my goal to become a developer.</p>
